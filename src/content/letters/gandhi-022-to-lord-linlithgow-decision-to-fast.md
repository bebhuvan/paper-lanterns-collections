(Whereas Gandhiji in his letters defended the Congress stand Lord Linlithgow, the Viceroy continued to hold Congress responsible for the August 1942 rebellion. A vigorous anti-Congress, anti-Indian campaign was launched in Foreign countries and a ruthless repression let loose on Indian 'rebels'. Gandhiji was pained at the sight of such a tyrannical policy of the Government. He therefore decided to go on fast and sent the following letter to the Viceroy.)

**THE GOVERNMENT GOADED THE PEOPLE TO THE POINT OF MADNESS.**

Dear Lord Linlithgow,

I must thank you warmly for your prompt reply to my letter of the 19th instant. I wish I could agree with you that your letter is clear. I am sure you do not wish to imply by clearness simply you hold a particular opinion strongly. I have pleaded and would continue to plead till the last breath that you should at least make an attempt to convince me of the validity of opinion you hold that the August resolution of the Congress is responsible for the popular violence that broke out on August 9 last and after even though it broke out after the wholesale arrest of principal leaders. Was not the drastic and unwarranted action of the Government responsible for the reported violence?

You have not even said what part of the August resolution is bad or offensive in your opinion. That resolution is in no way a retraction by the Congress of its policy of non-violence. It is definitely against Fascism in every shape or form. It tenders co-operation in war effort under circumstances which alone can make effective and nation-wide co-operation possible. Is all this open to reproach? Objection may be raised to that clause of the resolution which contemplated civil disobedience. But that by itself cannot constitute an objection since the principle of civil disobedience is impliedly conceded in what is known as the 'Gandhi-Irwin Pact'. Even that civil disobedience was not to be started before knowing the result of the meeting for which I was to seek from you an appointment.

Then take the unproved and in my opinion unprovable charges hurled against the Congress and me by so responsible a Minister as the Secretary of State for India.

Surely, I can say with safety that it is for the Government to justify their action by solid evidence, not by mere 'ipse dixit'.

But you throw in my face the facts of murders by persons reputed to be Congressmen. I see the fact of the murders as clearly as I hope, as you do. My answer is that the Government goaded the people to the point of madness. They started leonine violence in the shape of the arrests already referred to. That violence is not any the less so, because it is organised on a scale so gigantic that it displaces the Mosaic Law of tooth for tooth by that of ten thousand for one—not to mention the corollary of the Mosaic Law, i.e., of non-resistance as enunciated by Jesus Christ. I cannot interpret in any other manner the repressive measures of the all-powerful Government of India.

Add to this tale of woe the privations of the poor millions due to India-wide scarcity which I cannot help thinking might have been largely mitigated, if not altogether prevented, had there been a bona fide National Government responsible to a popularly elected assembly.

If then I cannot get soothing balm for my pain I must resort to the law prescribed for Satyagrahis, namely, a fast according to capacity. I must commence after the early morning breakfast of February 9, a fast for 21 days ending on March 2. Usually during my fasts, I take water with the addition of salts. But nowadays my system refused water. This time therefore I propose to add juices of citrus fruit to make water drinkable. For, my wish is not to fast unto death, but to survive the ordeal, if God so will. This fast can be ended sooner by the Government giving the needed relief.

I am not marking this letter personal as I did the two previous ones. They were in no way confidential. They were a mere personal appeal.

I am,
Your sincere friend,
M. K. GANDHI.
