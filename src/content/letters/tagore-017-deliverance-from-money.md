You must have heard by this time, from different sources, that our American tour has been cancelled. The atmosphere of our mind has been cleared, at a sweep, of the dense fog of the contemplation of securing money. This is deliverance.

In the meanwhile I have spent about a fortnight in Holland. This fortnight has been most generous in its gifts to me. It has condensed the love and fellowship of fifteen years into fifteen days and has made it mine. This you may be sure of, that a communication of heart has been opened up between this little country and Santiniketan, and it remains with us to widen it and make use of it for the interchange of spiritual wealth. Altogether Europe has come closer to us by this visit of ours. I only wish all my friends in Santiniketan could realise how true it is and what a wealth it represents. Now I know more clearly than ever before that Santiniketan belongs to all the world and we shall have to be worthy of this great fact. It is extremely difficult for us Indians to forget all the irritations that ever keep our consciousness concentrated on our own daily annoyances. But emancipation of consciousness is both the means and the end of spiritual life. Therefore Santiniketan must be saved from the whirlwind of our dusty politics. Our one mantram for meditation is 'Shantam, Shivam, Advaitam,'

I am writing this letter from Antwerp where I came yesterday morning, and I am getting ready to go to Brussels where I have an invitation. And then I go to Paris.
