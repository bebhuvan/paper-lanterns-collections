**Editorial Note**

The following is the full text of Dostoevsky's letter, written on the day he was sentenced to death, December 22, 1849, to his brother Mihail. Only the first paragraph of the letter has been published before. It is now published in full for the first time. It is a document of exceptional importance.

The original letter cannot now be traced. But a copy of it, made by Madame Dostoevsky, is now kept in the Central Archives. It has now been made public.

Mihail Dostoevsky was, after all, allowed to see Fiodor before his departure for Siberia. In his *Reminiscences* (1881), A. P. Miliukov relates that Fiodor said to his brother at parting:

> 'During these three months I have gone through much; I mean, I have gone through much in myself; and now there are the things I am going to see and go through. There will be much to be written.'


LETTER FROM F. M. DOSTOEVSKY TO HIS BROTHER

The Peter and Paul Fortress  
December 22, 1849  

Mihail Mihailovich Dostoevsky,  
Nevsky Prospect, opposite Gryazny Street,  
in the house of Neslind.

Brother, my precious friend, all is settled! I am sentenced to four years’ hard labour in the fortress (I believe, at Orenburg), and after that to serve as a private.

Today, the 22nd of December, we were taken to the Semionov Drill Ground. There the sentence of death was read to all of us. We were told to kiss the Cross, our swords were broken over our heads, and our last toilet was made (white shirts). Then three were tied to the pillar for execution. I was the sixth. Three at a time were called out; consequently, I was in the second batch and no more than a minute was left me to live.

I remembered you, brother, and all yours. During that last minute you, you alone, were in my mind. Only then did I realise how I love you, dear brother mine! I also managed to embrace Plescheyev and Durov, who stood close to me, and to say good-bye to them.

Finally, the retreat was sounded, and those tied to the pillar were led back. It was announced to us that His Imperial Majesty granted us our lives. Then followed the present sentences. Palm alone has been pardoned and returns with his old rank to the army.

I have just been told, dear brother, that today or tomorrow we are to be sent off. I asked to see you, but I was told that this was impossible; I may only write you this letter. Make haste and give me a reply as soon as you can. I am afraid that you may somehow have heard of our death sentence. From the windows of the prison-van, when we were taken to the Semionov Drill Ground, I saw a multitude of people; perhaps the news reached you, and you suffered for me. Now you will be easier on my account.

Brother, I have not become downhearted or low-spirited. Life is everywhere life, life in ourselves, not in what is outside us. There will be people near me, and to be a man among people and remain a man for ever, not to be downhearted nor to fall, whatever misfortunes may befall me – this is life; this is the task of life. I have realised this. This idea has entered into my flesh and into my blood. Yes, it is true!

The head which was creating, living with the highest life of art, which had realised and grown used to the highest needs of the spirit – that head has already been cut off from my shoulders. There remain the memory and the images created but not yet incarnated by me. They will lacerate me, it is true. But there remains in me my heart and the same flesh and blood which can also love, and suffer, and desire, and remember, and this, after all, is life. On voit le soleil!

Now, good-bye, brother. Don’t grieve for me!

Now about material things. My books (I still have the Bible) and several sheets of my manuscript – the rough plan of the play and the novel (and the finished story “A Child’s Tale”) – have been taken away from me, and in all probability will be got by you. I also leave my overcoat and old clothes, if you send to fetch them.

Now, brother, I may perhaps have to march a long distance. Money is needed. My dear brother, when you receive this letter, and if there is any possibility of getting some money, send it me at once. Money I need now more than air (for one particular purpose). Send me also a few lines. Then, if the money from Moscow comes, remember me and do not desert me.

Well, that is all. I have debts, but what can I do?

Kiss your wife and children. Remind them of me continually; see that they do not forget me. Perhaps we shall yet meet some time!

Brother, take care of yourself and of your family; live quietly and carefully. Think of the future of your children… live positively.

There has never yet been working in me such a healthy abundance of spiritual life as now. But will my body endure? I do not know. I am going away sick; I suffer from scrofula. But never mind!

Brother, I have already gone through so much in life that now hardly anything can frighten me. Let come what may! At the first opportunity I shall let you know about myself.

Give the Maikovs my farewell and last greetings. Tell them that I thank them all for their constant interest in my fate. Say a few words for me – as warm as possible, as your heart will prompt you – to Eugenia Petrovna. I wish her much happiness and shall ever remember her with grateful respect. Press the hands of Nikolay Apollonovich and Apollon Maikov, and also of all the others. Find Yanovsky. Press his hand; thank him. Finally, press the hands of all who have not forgotten me. And those who have forgotten me – remember me to them also.

Kiss our brother Kolya. Write a letter to our brother Andrey and let him know about me. Write also to Uncle and Aunt. This I ask you in my own name, and greet them for me. Write to our sisters: I wish them happiness.

And maybe we shall meet again some time, brother! Take care of yourself; go on living, for the love of God, until we meet. Perhaps some time we shall embrace each other and recall our youth, our golden time that was, our youth and our hopes, which at this very instant I am tearing out from my heart with my blood, to bury them.

Can it indeed be that I shall never take a pen into my hands? I think that after the four years there may be a possibility. I shall send you everything that I may write, if I write anything, my God! How many imaginations, lived through by me, created by me anew, will perish, will be extinguished in my brain, or will be spilt as poison in my blood! Yes, if I am not allowed to write, I shall perish. Better fifteen years of prison with a pen in my hands!

Write to me more often, write more details, more, more facts. In every letter write about all kinds of family details, of trifles; don’t forget. This will give me hope and life. If you knew how your letters revived me here in the fortress! These last two months and a half, when it was forbidden to write or receive a letter, have been very hard on me. I was ill.

The fact that you did not send me money now and then worried me on your account; it meant you yourself were in great need. Kiss the children once again; their lovely little faces do not leave my mind. Ah, that they may be happy! Be happy yourself too, brother, be happy!

But do not grieve, for the love of God, do not grieve for me! Do believe that I am not downhearted; do remember that hope has not deserted me. In four years there will be a mitigation of my fate. I shall be a private soldier – no longer a prisoner – and remember that some time I shall embrace you.

I was today in the grip of death for three-quarters of an hour; I have lived it through with that idea; I was at the last instant, and now I live again!

If anyone has bad memories of me, if I have quarrelled with anyone, if I have created in anyone an unpleasant impression – tell them they should forget it, if you manage to meet them. There is no gall or spite in my soul. I should dearly love to embrace any one of my former friends at this moment. It is a comfort. I experienced it today when saying good-bye to my dear ones before death.

I thought at that moment that the news of the execution would kill you. But now be easy; I am still alive and shall live in the future with the thought that some time I shall embrace you. Only this is now in my mind.

What are you doing? What have you been thinking today? Do you know about us? How cold it was today!

Ah, if only my letter reaches you soon. Otherwise I shall be for four months without news of you. I saw the envelopes in which you sent money during the last two months; the address was written in your hand, and I was glad that you were well.

When I look back at the past and think how much time has been wasted in vain, how much time was lost in delusions, in errors, in idleness, in ignorance of how to live, how I did not value time, how often I sinned against my heart and spirit – my heart bleeds. Life is a gift, life is happiness; each minute might have been an age of happiness. Si jeunesse savait!

Now, changing my life, I am being reborn into a new form. Brother, I swear to you that I shall not lose hope and shall preserve my spirit and heart in purity. I shall be reborn to a better thing. That is my whole hope, my whole comfort!

The life in prison has already sufficiently killed in me the demands of the flesh which were not wholly pure; I took little heed of myself before. Now privations are nothing to me, and, therefore, do not fear that any material hardship will kill me. This cannot be! Ah, to have health!

Good-bye, good-bye, my brother! When shall I write you again? You will receive from me as detailed an account as possible of my journey. If I can only preserve my health, then everything will be right!

Well, good-bye, good-bye, brother! I embrace you closely, I kiss you closely. Remember me without pain in your heart. Do not grieve, I pray you, do not grieve for me! In the next letter I shall tell you how I go on. Remember what I have told you: plan out your life, do not waste it, arrange your destiny, think of your children.

Oh, to see you, to see you! Good-bye!

Now I tear myself away from everything that was dear; it is painful to leave it! It is painful to break oneself in two, to cut the heart in two. Good-bye, good-bye! But I shall see you, I am convinced – I hope. Do not change, love me, do not let your memory grow cold, and the thought of your love will be the best part of my life. Good-bye, good-bye once more! Good-bye to all!

Your brother,  
Fiodor Dostoevsky.  

December 22, 1849.

P.S. At my arrest several books were taken away from me. Only two of them were prohibited books. Won’t you get the rest for yourself? But there is this request: one of the books was The Works of Valerian Maikov, his critical essays – Eugenia Petrovna’s copy. It was her treasure, and she lent it to me. At my arrest I asked the police officer to return that book to her, and gave him the address. I do not know if he returned it to her. Make enquiries. I do not want to take this memory away from her.

Once again press Emily Fiodorovna’s hand, kiss the little ones. Remember me to Krayevsky, perhaps…

Write me more particularly about your arrest, confinement, and liberation.
