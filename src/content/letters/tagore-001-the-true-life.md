The heat was tolerable and the journey fairly good though the train reached Bombay nearly three hours late.

I feel that we are not likely to be long in Europe. I am not in a mood to face the world and answer its questions.

One grows old, to discover that spontaneous simplicity of life is the true life—but where are the time and the opportunity to realise it? It requires a great deal of courage to demolish the walls that one has himself built with all his resources. This building and breaking down both are needed. The cocoon becomes a true prison, only when it persists beyond its time. I wonder if my soul has its wings developed—but it is pining for freedom.

Good bye—try to cultivate restfulness and have leisure to woo your true self and gain her for good.
