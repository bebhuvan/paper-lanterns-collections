Owing to change of plans and other reasons we are still detained in London. We hope to leave it the day after to-morrow. Now that the people believe that we are away and also your weather has ceased to persecute us, these last two days have been very restful for me. I wonder if you know at the last moment we decided not to begin our tour for Norway though our tickets were bought. I am sure you are ready to ascribe this to the inconstancy of my mind!

*P.S.* I have just written this about Dr. Patrick Geddes.

What so strongly attracted me in Dr. Patrick Geddes when I came to know him in India, was not his scientific achievements, but, on the contrary, the rare fact of the fulness of his personality rising far above his science. Whatever he has studied and mastered has become vitally one with his humanity. He has the precision of the scientist and, at the same time, the vision of the prophet. He has also the power of an artist to make his ideas visible through the language of symbol. His love of man has given him the insight to see the truth of man, and imagination to realise in the world the infinite mystery of life, not merely its mechanical aspect.
