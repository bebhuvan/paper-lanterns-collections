We shall reach Suez this evening. It is already beginning to grow cold, and now I feel that we have reached a truly foreign part of the world and it is under the rule of different gods than ours. Our hearts are strangers in this region and even the atmosphere of this place looks askance at us. The people here want us to fight their battles and supply them with our raw materials, but they keep us standing outside their doors over which is written on the notice board: “Trespassers from Asia will be prosecuted.” When I think of this all my thoughts shiver with cold and I feel home-sick for the sunny corner in my Santiniketan bungalow.

To-day is Monday, and on the next Sunday morning our steamer will reach Marseilles. But I am already counting the days for my return journey; and I know the sight of the bare rocks of Aden will give a thrill of delight to my heart while pointing with lifted fingers the way to India.
