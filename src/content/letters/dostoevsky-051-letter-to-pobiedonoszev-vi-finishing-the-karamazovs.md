Deeply esteemed and kindest Konstantin Petrovich, I thank you from my whole soul for your good, splendid, enheartening letter. Enheartening, indeed, for I, as a man, always need the encouragement of those in whom I believe, whose understanding and convictions I deeply respect. Every time I write something and send it for publication—I am as in a fever. Not that I did not believe in what I myself had written, but always the question torments me: how will it be taken? Will people want to understand the essence of the matter? Would it not rather result in bad than in good that I made public my intimate convictions? The more so that I am always compelled to express certain thoughts only in the basic idea, which always greatly needs a further development and argumentation. And the opinion of men like you—is positively my support! It means then, I was not mistaken in everything, it means, I was understood by those whose understanding and impartial judgment I value, and, therefore, my labour was not in vain.

I tell you frankly: now I am finishing the *Karamazovs*. This last part, I myself see and feel, is so original and unlike what others write, that I positively do not expect the approval of our critics; the public, the readers—that is a different matter: they always supported me. I should be deeply grateful to you if you give your attention to what will be published in the August number of the *Russky Viestnik* (which is now being printed), and then in the September number where the fourth and last part of the *Karamazovs* ends. In the September book will be a trial, our crown-prosecutors and advocates—all this will be shown in a particular light. *The Journal of an Author* I decided to bring out in the coming year without fail. The present, ‘only number for this year,’ has had an indubitable success with the public: in three days up to 3000 copies sold in Petersburg alone, and I brought out altogether 4200 copies. I think I shall have to publish a second edition.

My wife told me how kindly you had received her. I thank you for sending me the *Varshavsky Dnievnik*. Leontiev after all is a bit of a heretic—did you notice it? Anyhow, of this I shall talk to you in person, when I come to Petersburg at the end of September; there’s much of interest in his opinions.

—Accept, deeply respected Konstantin Petrovich, the assurance not only of my sincerest feelings, but also of my profound, great hope for all the good which I expect, and not only myself, but every one, from your new splendid activity.—Your adherent and admirer F. DOSTOEVSKY.
