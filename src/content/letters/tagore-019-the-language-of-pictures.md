I had not even a distant idea before I came to the Continent what a welcome had been waiting for me in Europe. I see more clearly every day what is asked of me and what is the meaning of my Santiniketan. The West and the East are to meet in the coming age, and there must be seats made for such meeting. Let Santiniketan send her call through me for this union of spirits.

I feel that the response will come. If all my friends of the Ashram were with me they could have no doubt about this. They would have felt that it would give greater glory to India, if she could bring men from all parts of the world to realise that true patriotism is for the spiritual kingdom, rather than for any crumb of favour thrown to her from the table of her political masters.

This was the reason which made me change my mind and decide to go to the Americans. For they must listen to the appeal of the East. I am leaving Paris to-morrow for London to make preparations to sail across the Atlantic. For some weeks to come you will receive no letters from me, but keep this in mind that not to be able to return to our Ashram and to be in the midst of you, when it was about to happen, is a pain which I hope will be accepted by my Providence as a fit price for the great object to which I aspire.
