To-day is the seventh of Paus. I wish it were allowed to me to stand among you in the *mandir* and mingle my voice with yours in uttering our prayer. It is real starvation for my heart to be deprived of this great privilege. To-day I realise more than ever before, that nothing can be truer for me than to be with my dear children and friends, this beautiful sunny morning of December, and bow my head to our Father and dedicate my service to Him. By that dedication our works become great, and not by extension of external resources. Oh, how simple is truth and how full of light and happiness? Not to be distracted by the curiosity of crowds, only to be rewarded by the approval of Him, who knows our heart, is the fulfilment of our endeavour. I only hope that what I am doing here is in response to the call of the Shantam, that my lonely celebration of seventh Paus in this Hotel room finds its harmony with your festival. Let our faith in the real be not overcome by the lure of the unreal. Let come to us what is good and not what we desire. Let us bow our head to the Good, to the supreme Good.

I have often felt the desire that you were with me in my adventure. And yet I am deeply thankful that you could remain in the Ashram while I was away. For you understand me with the understanding of love, and, therefore, through you I seem to dwell in Santiniketan. I know that I am in your mind to-day and you know that my heart is with you. Is it not a great good fortune that there is a spot in this world, where all that is best in us can meet in truth and love? Can anything be greater than that? Please give my blessings to all my boys and girls, and my greetings of love to my friends.
