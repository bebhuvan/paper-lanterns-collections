There is one thing about which I wish to speak to you. Keep Santiniketan away from the turmoils of politics. I know, that the political problem is growing in intensity in India and its encroachment is difficult to resist. But, all the same, we must never forget that our mission is not political. Where I have my politics, I do not belong to Santiniketan.

I do not mean to say that there is anything wrong in politics, but only that it is out of harmony with our Ashram.

We must clearly realise this fact, that the name Santiniketan has a meaning for us, and this name will have to be made true. I am anxious and afraid lest the surrounding forces may become too strong for us and we succumb to the onslaught of the present time. Because the time is troubled and the minds of men distracted all the more must we, through our Ashram, maintain our faith in Shantam, Shivam, Advaitam.
