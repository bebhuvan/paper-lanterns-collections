To-day is New Year’s Day. But I do not feel it in the air; it brings no message to me. New Year comes to these countries with possibilities of new inventions, new political adjustments, and economic revolutions. But the New Year which we know in Santiniketan comes to our soul bringing the expectation of its own blossoming, through some inner miracle of renovation. Last night the whole town went mad with a boisterous fury of merriment and this morning it is too tired to open its heart to the beautiful sunlight of the New Year’s Day. All the while my heart is aching to think that our first day of Baisakh will bring its blessings for me in the early morning light of Santiniketan and find my seat vacant. How precious with truth and peace those days are made, we know when our hearts are wandering in a wilderness of things, thirsting for a drop of *Amrita*, the draught of everlasting life.

In the geological history of the Earth we had ages of Titanic storms circulating round this globe. But now in the human period of this planet it is the dust storm of buildings and business, that is sweeping over the face of the earth. In those remote ages of turbulent hot vapour, the earth remained shrouded in a suffocating gloom, ignorant of its kinship with the starry world. But that pall of blindness has been lifted and the light has brought to the world of life its message of the Eternal. The tornado of the present-day towns will also pass off; the Dervish dance of dust will be quieted and the human mind will find its communication with the Infinite unhindered. We do not even have time to realise with what longing the human spirit is waiting to find itself in that unobstructed realm of light. But the light will come to her at last and reveal the endless beauty of truth.

Occasionally I read in the newspapers the reports of the Non-co-operation movement in India. It seems to me that its current is getting muddied with a great amount of unreason. The forces that mould our history are irrational; but our leaders who guide those forces must have sanity and far-sightedness. To be in league with the spirit of destruction is dangerous; for its methods are easy, its results are quick and stupendous in wholesale negations. But it obstructs our roads with the ruin it causes, raising its barriers of rubbish heaps between us and our vision of the beyond.
