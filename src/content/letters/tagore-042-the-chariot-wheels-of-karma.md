Tied to the chariot wheels of *karma* we flit from one birth to another. What that means to the individual soul I have been made to realise in these last few days. It is my tyrant *karma*, which is dragging me from one hotel to another. Between my two hotel incarnations I usually have my sleep in a Pullman Car, the very name of which suggests the agency of death. I am ever dreaming of the day, when I shall attain my Nirvana, freed from this chain of hotel lives, and reach utter peace in *Uttarayana*!

I have not written to you for some time. For I am tired to the profound depth of my being. Yet, since coming to Texas, I have felt as it were a sudden coming of Spring into my life through a breach in the ice castle of Winter. It has come to me like a revelation, that all these days my soul had been thirsting for the draught of sunshine poured from the beaker of infinite space. The sky has embraced me, and the warmth of its caress thrills me with joy.

The people here in Texas have had the leisure and opportunity of storing this sunshine in the cellar of their hearts—they are human and hospitable. However, the time for our departure from this country is drawing near.
